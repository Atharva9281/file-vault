# Note: This docker-compose is for local development only.
# For production, deploy to Cloud Run using the Dockerfile directly.
#
# Usage:
#   Development: docker-compose up
#   Production build test: docker-compose up --build
#   Cleanup: docker-compose down
#
# The backend connects to:
#   - Cloud Storage (GCS) - via service account
#   - Cloud SQL - via Cloud SQL Connector
#   - Document AI, Cloud DLP, Vertex AI - via GCP APIs
#
# All GCP services require proper authentication via service account key.
